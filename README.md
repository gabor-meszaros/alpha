# Welcome!

This is the repository of Alpha, the Swiss Army Workstation. The project was started because I needed an easily reproducible, multi platform, well configured, feature rich environment to solve some small scriptable/special problems without installing too much things on my Windows PC and spending too much time with configuring a lot of settings.

## How to install

**Prerequisites**: You will need [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed on your machine before you can use Alpha.

Once you have done, you can follow the following steps.

  1. Download the seed files
     
     >
     > git clone https://github.com/gabor-meszaros/alpha.git
     >

  2. Start the environment setup. Depending on your internet connection and your machine it can take some minutes.
     
     >
     > cd alpha
     > vagrant up
     >

  3. Enter the environment
     
     >
     > vagrant ssh
     >

Enjoy!
